i. Assignment statement "=" in Python is the statement which assign the RHS of the code to the LHS. 
   RHS can be any combination of code such as summation between a and b but LHS can only be a single variable. 


    Example: 

    a_int = 7 
    b_int = a_int 

    In the example above a_int is being assigned to the value stored in b_int. 

    Example: 
    a_int = b_int + 7 (valid)
    a_int + 7 = b_int (Error)

    


ii. In interpreted language, the code is run or interpreted line by line while compiled language will compiled the
    whole code before running as an output. In interpreted language, it is slower compared to the compiled language.
